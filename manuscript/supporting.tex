{\bf Dependence of computed density on simulation timestep.}
To probe the systematic error from finite time-step integration, we examined the timestep dependence of butyl acrylate density.  
(a).  The density is shown for several choices of timestep.  
(b).  The relative error, as compared to the reference value, is shown for several choices of timestep.  
Error bars represent standard errors of the mean, with the number of effective samples estimated using pymbar's statistical inefficiency routine \cite{shirts2008statistically}.  
The reference value is estimated by linear extrapolation to 0 fs using the 0.5 fs and 1.0 fs data points; the linear extrapolation is shown as black lines.  
We find a 2~fs timestep leads to systematic biases in the density on the order of 0.13\%, while 1 fs reduces the systematic bias to approximately 0.03\%---we therefore selected a 1~fs timestep for the present work, where we aimed to achieve three digits of accuracy in density predictions.

\caption{{\bf Assessment of experimental error: Density}
To assess the experimental error in our ThermoML extract, we compared three different estimates of uncertainty.  
In the first approach (Weighted), we computed the standard deviation of the optimally weighted average of the measurements, using the uncertainties reported by authors ($\sigma_\textnormal{Weighted} = [\sum_k \sigma_k^{-2}]^{-0.5}$).
This uncertainty estimator places the highest weights on measurements with small uncertainties and is therefore easily dominated by small outliers and uncertainty under-reporting.
In the second approach (Median), we estimated the median of the uncertainties reported by authors; this statistic should be robust to small and large outliers of author-reported uncertainties.
In the third approach (Std), we calculated at the standard deviation of independent measurements reported in the ThermoML extract, completely avoiding the author-reported uncertainties.
Plot (a) compares the three uncertainty estimates.
We see that author-reported uncertainties appear to be substantially smaller than the scatter between the observed measurements.
A simple psychological explanation might be that because density measurements are more routine, the authors simply report the repeatability stated by the manufacturer (e.g.,~0.0001 g/cm$^{3}$ for a Mettler Toledo DM40~\cite{mettlertoledo}).  
However, this hardware limit is not achieved due to inconsistencies in sample preparation and experimental conditions; see Appendix in Ref.~\cite{chirico2013improvement}.  
Panel (b) shows the same information as (a) but as a function of the measurement index, rather than as a scatter plot---because not all measurements have author-supplied uncertainties, panel (c) contains slightly more data points than (a, b).  
%{\color{red}[JDC: Should discuss with Kenneth what kind of story to make out of this, and what to say in the main manuscript body.]}
%KAB: I think the error analysis is now partially discussed in the density sections.

\subsection{Dependency Installation}
\label{section:commands}

The following shell commands can be used to install the necessary prerequisites via the {\tt conda} package manager for Python:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ conda config --add channels http://conda.binstar.org/omnia
$ conda install "openmoltools" "pymbar==2.1" "mdtraj==1.3" "openmm==6.3" packmol
%\end{lstlisting}

Note that this command installs the exact versions used in the present study, with the exception of openmoltools for which only a more recent package is available.  
However, for authors interested in extending the present work, we suggust using the most up-to-date versions available instead, which involves replacing the equality symbols $==$ with $>=$.
