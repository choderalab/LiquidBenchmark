%\section{Abstract}
\begin{abstract}

Atomistic molecular simulations are a powerful way to make quantitative predictions, but the accuracy of these predictions depends entirely on the quality of the forcefield employed.
While experimental measurements of fundamental physical properties offer a straightforward approach for evaluating forcefield quality, the bulk of this information has been tied up in formats that are not machine-readable.
These formats require substantial human effort to compile benchmark datasets which are prone to accumulation of human errors, hindering the development of reproducible benchmarks of forcefield accuracy.
Here, we examine the feasibility of benchmarking atomistic forcefields against the NIST ThermoML data archive of physicochemical measurements, which aggregates thousands of experimental measurements in a portable, machine-readable, self-annotating format. 
As a proof of concept, we present a detailed benchmark of the generalized Amber small molecule forcefield (GAFF) using the AM1-BCC charge model against measurements (specifically bulk liquid densities and static dielectric constants at ambient pressure) automatically extracted from the archive, and discuss the extent of available data.  
The results of this benchmark highlights a general problem with fixed-charge forcefields in the representation of liquids of low dielectric.\\

\section{Introduction}

Recent advances in hardware and software for molecular dynamics simulation now permit routine access to atomistic simulations at the 100 ns timescale and beyond~\cite{salomon2013routine}.
Leveraging these advances in combination with consumer GPU clusters, distributed computing, or custom hardware has brought microsecond and millisecond simulation timescales within reach of many laboratories.  
These dramatic advances in sampling, however, have revealed deficiencies in forcefields as a critical barrier to enabling truly predictive simulations of physical properties of biomolecular systems.  

Protein and water forcefields have been the subject of numerous benchmarks~\cite{lindorff2012systematic} and enhancements~\cite{li2011iterative, best2012optimization, Lindorff-Larsen2010}, with key outcomes including the ability to fold fast-folding proteins \cite{shaw2011, ensign2007heterogeneity, Voelz2010}, improved fidelity of water thermodynamic properties~\cite{horn2004}, and improved prediction of NMR observables.  
Although small molecule forcefields have also been the subject of benchmarks~\cite{caleman2011force} and improvements~\cite{fennell2014fixed}, such work has typically focused on small perturbations to specific functional groups.  
For example, a recent study found that modified hydroxyl nonbonded parameters led to improved prediction of static dielectric constants and hydration free energies~\cite{fennell2014fixed}.
There are also outstanding questions of generalizability of these targeted perturbations; it is uncertain whether changes to the parameters for a specific chemical moiety will be compatible with seemingly unrelated improvements to other groups.
Addressing these questions requires establishing a community agreement on shared benchmarks that can be easily replicated among laboratories to test proposed forcefield enhancements and expanded as the body of experimental data grows.

A key barrier to establishing reproducible and extensible forcefield accuracy benchmarks is that many experimental datasets are heterogeneous, paywalled, and unavailable in machine-readable formats (although notable counterexamples exist, e.g.~the RCSB~\cite{Berman2000}, FreeSolv~\cite{freesolv}, and the BMRB~\cite{Ulrich2008}).  
While this inconvenience is relatively minor for benchmarking forcefield accuracy for a single target system (e.g.~water), it becomes prohibitive for studies spanning the relevant chemical space.  
To ameliorate problems of data archival, the NIST Thermodynamics Research Center (TRC) has developed a IUPAC standard XML-based format---ThermoML~\cite{frenkel2006xml}---for storing physicochemical measurements, uncertainties, and metadata.
Experimental researchers publishing measurements in several journals (J.~Chem.~Eng.~Data, J.~Chem.~Therm., Fluid Phase Equil., Therm.~Acta, and Int.~J.~Therm.) are guided through a data archival process that involves sanity checks, conversion to a standard machine-readable format, and archival at the TRC (\url{http://trc.nist.gov/ThermoML.html}).  

Here, we examine the ThermoML archive as a potential source for providing the foundation for a reproducible, extensible accuracy benchmark of biomolecular forcefields.
In particular, we concentrate on two important physical property measurements easily computable in many simulation codes---neat liquid density and static dielectric constant measurements---with the goal of developing a standard benchmark for validating these properties in fixed-charge forcefields of drug-like molecules and biopolymer residue analogues.  
These two properties provide sensitive tests of forcefield accuracy that are nonetheless straightforward to calculate.  
Using these data, we evaluate the generalized Amber small molecule forcefield (GAFF)~\cite{gaff,gaff2} with the AM1-BCC charge model~\cite{am1bcc1,am1bcc2} and identify systematic biases to aid further forcefield refinement.

\section{Methods}
\label{section:methods}

\subsection{ThermoML Archive retrieval and processing}
\label{section:thermoml-archive-retrieval}

A tarball archive snapshot of the ThermoML Archive was obtained from the the NIST TRC on 13 Sep 2014.
{\color{red}[JDC: Because readers cannot easily extract a specific daily snapshot, I think we also want to make the archive subset we used in this paper available as Supplementary Information.]}
{\color{blue}[KAB: So the Github page for the paper will have CSV files for the processed dataset.  I wonder if that will be sufficient.  Alternatively, we can put those CSV files in the SI.  The advantage of github is that the data lives with the code, which could help reproducibility.]}
To explore the content of this archive, we created a Python (version 2.7.9) tool (ThermoPyL: \url{https://github.com/choderalab/ThermoPyL}) that formats the XML content into a spreadsheet-like format accessible via the Pandas (version 0.15.2) library.  
First, we obtained the XML schema (\url{http://media.iupac.org/namespaces/ThermoML/ThermoML.xsd}) defining the layout of the data.
This schema was converted into a Python object via PyXB 1.2.4 (\url{http://pyxb.sourceforge.net/}).
Finally, this schema was used to extract the data into Pandas~\cite{pandas} dataframes, and the successive filters data filters described in Section~\ref{section:filtering-thermoml} were applied.  

\subsection{Simulation}
\label{section:simulation}

\subsubsection{Preparation}
\label{section:preparation}

Simulation boxes containing 1000 molecules were constructed using PackMol version 14-225~\cite{martinez2009packmol, packmolurl} wrapped in an automated tool.
Packmol boxes volumes were chosen to accomodate twice the van der Waals volumne of the enclosed atoms.  
AM1-BCC~\cite{am1bcc1,am1bcc2, velez2014time} charges were generated with the OpenEye Python Toolkit version 2015-2-3 \cite{openeye}, using the {\tt oequacpac.OEAssignPartialCharges} module with the {\tt OECharges\_AM1BCCSym} option, which utilizes a conformational expansion procedure prior to charge fitting to minimize artifacts from intramolecular contacts.  
The selected conformer was then processed using {\tt antechamber} (with {\tt parmchk2}) and {\tt tleap} in AmberTools~14~\cite{amber14} to produce {\tt prmtop} and {\tt inpcrd} files, which were then read into OpenMM using the {\tt simtk.openmm.app} module.
Simulation code used libraries gaff2xml~0.6.4~\cite{gaff2xml}, OpenMM~6.3~\cite{eastman2012openmm}, and MDTraj~1.3~\cite{mcgibbon2014mdtraj}.  
Exact commands to install various dependencies can be found in section \ref{section:commands}.

\subsubsection{Equilibration and production}
\label{section:production}

Boxes were first minimized and equilibrated for $10^7$ steps with an equilibration timestep of 0.4 fs and a collision rate of 5 ps$^{-1}$.  
Production simulations were performed with OpenMM~6.2~\cite{eastman2012openmm} using a Langevin integrator (with collision rate 1 ps$^{-1}$) and a 1~fs timestep, as we found that timesteps of 2~fs timestep or greater led to a significant timestep dependence in computed equilibrium densities (Table~\ref{figure:timestep}).  
{\color{red}[JDC: Cite Langevin integrator used in OpenMM.]}
{\color{red}[KAB: please provide the reference.]}
Pressure control to 1 atm was achieved with a Monte Carlo barostat utilizing molecular scaling and automated step size adjustment during equilibration, with volume moves attempted every 25 steps.  
The particle mesh Ewald (PME) method~\cite{Darden1993} was used with a long-range cutoff of 0.95~nm and a long-range isotropic dispersion correction. 
PME grid and spline parameters were automatically selected using the default settings in OpenMM 6.3 for the CUDA platform.
{\color{red}[JDC: Can we report the automatically-selected PME parameters to aid reproducibility in other codes?]}
{\color{blue}[KAB: This would depend on the individual molecule, temperature, and (?) platform, so for now I've mentioned that the parameters are automatically chosen.]}

Simulations were continued until automatic analysis showed standard errors in densities were less than $2 \times 10^{-4}$ g / mL.
Automatic analysis was run every 1 ns of simulation time, and utilized the {\tt detectEquilibration} method in the timeseries module of pymbar 2.1~\cite{shirts2008statistically} to automatically trim the initial portion of the simulation with strong far-from-equilibrium behavior by maximizing the number of effectively uncorrelated samples in the remainder of the production simulation as determined by autocorrelation analysis.
Statistical errors were computed after subsampling the data to produce effectively uncorrelated equilibrium samples by $\delta^2 \rho \approx \var{\rho} / N_\mathrm{eff}$, where $\var{\rho}$ is the sample variance of the density and $N_\mathrm{eff}$ is the number of effectively uncorrelated samples.  
With this protocol, we found starting trajectory lengths of $14000 \pm 11000$ frames (250 fs each), discarded regions of $1800 \pm 5600$, and statistical inefficiencies of $30 \pm 34$ (mean $\pm$ standard deviation).  

Instantaneous densities were stored every 250~fs, while trajectory snapshots were stored every 5~ps.  

\subsubsection{Data analysis and statistical error estimation}

Trajectory analysis was performed using OpenMM~6.3~\cite{eastman2012openmm} and MDTraj~1.3~\cite{mcgibbon2014mdtraj}.  
{\color{red}[JDC: Did we plan to make this data available somewhere, or is it sufficient to put out the scripts?]}
{\color{blue}[KAB: I think our data is too big, we're on the order of 50GB.]}


Mass density $\rho$ was computed via the relation,
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho = \left\langle \frac{M}{V} \right\rangle \label{equation:mass-density} ,
 \end{eqnarray}
where $M$ is the total mass of all particles in the system and $V$ is the instantaneous volume of the simulation box.

Static dielectric constants were calculated using the dipole fluctuation approach appropriate for PME with conducting (``tin-foil'') boundary conditions~\cite{horn2004, neumann1983dipole}, with the total system box dipole $\mu$ computed from trajectory snapshots using MDTraj 1.3~\cite{mcgibbon2014mdtraj}.
\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon = 1 + \frac{4\pi}{3} \frac{\langle \mu \cdot \mu \rangle - \langle \mu \rangle \cdot \langle \mu \rangle}{\langle V \rangle k_B T} \label{equation:dielectric_calculation}
\end{eqnarray}

Statistical uncertainties were computed by boostrapping uncorrelated samples following discarding the automatically-determined initial portion of the simulation to equilibration, as described in Section~\ref{section:production}.
All reported uncertainties represent an estimate of one standard deviation of the mean unless otherwise reported.

\subsubsection{Code availability}

Data analysis, intermediate data (everything but trajectories), and figure creation code for this work is available at \url{https://github.com/choderalab/LiquidBenchmark}.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Extracting neat liquid measurements from the NIST TRC ThermoML Archive}
\label{section:filtering-thermoml}

As described in Section~\ref{section:thermoml-archive-retrieval}, we retrieved a copy of the ThermoML Archive and performed a number of sequential filtering steps to produce an ThermoML extract relevant for benchmarking forcefields describing small organic molecules.  
As our aim is to explore neat liquid data with functional groups relevant to biopolymers and drug-like molecules, we applied the following ordered filters, starting with all data containing density or static dielectric constants: 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The measured solution contains only a single component (e.g.~no binary mixtures)
 \item The molecule contains only druglike elements (defined here as H, N, C, O, S, P, F, Cl, Br)
 \item The molecule has $\le$ 10 heavy atoms
 \item The measurement was performed in a biophysically relevant temperature range $(270 \le T$ [K] $\le 330)$
 \item The measurement was performed at ambient pressure $(100 \le P$ [kPA]  $\le 102)$
 \item Only measurements in liquid phase were retained
 \item The temperature and pressure were rounded to nearby values (as described below), averaging all measurements within each group of like conditions
 \item Only conditions (molecule, temperature, pressure) for which \emph{both} density and dielectric constants were available were retained
\end{enumerate}
The temperature and pressure rounding step was motivated by common data reporting variations; for example, an experiment performed at the freezing temperature of water and ambient pressure might be entered as either 101.325~kPA or 100~kPA, with a temperature of either 273~K or 273.15~K.  
Therefore all pressures within the range [kPA] $(100 \le P \le 102)$ were rounded to exactly 1 atm (101.325 kPa).  
Temperatures were rounded to one decimal place in K. 

The application of these filters (Table~\ref{table:ThermoMLSummary}) leaves 245 conditions---where a \emph{condition} here indicates a (molecule, temperature, pressure) tuple---for which both density and dielectric data are available.  
The functional groups present in the resulting dataset are summarized in Table~\ref{table:FunctionalGroups}; see Section~\ref{section:thermoml-archive-retrieval} for further description of the software pipeline used.  

%{\color{red}[JDC: It might be useful to point the users to the scripts that were used to do this extraction.
%Also, can we automate the downloading of the complete up-to-date archive, perhaps with Kenneth's help in identifying the least intrusive way to do so?]}
% KAB: I believe that we can automate things.  However, given that it's not officially supported by TRC so IMHO we should postpone for a later work.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Benchmarking GAFF/AM1-BCC against the ThermoML Archive}

\subsubsection{Mass density}

Mass densities of bulk liquids have been widely used for parameterizing and testing forcefields, particularly the Lennard-Jones parameters representing dispersive and repulsive interactions~\cite{jorgensen1983comparison, jorgensen1984optimized}.
We therefore used the present ThermoML extract as a benchmark of the GAFF/AM1-BCC forcefield (Fig.~\ref{figure:Density}).  

Overall, the densities show reasonable accuracy, with a root-mean square (RMS) relative error over all measurements of 2.8$\pm$0.1\%, especially encouraging given that this forcefield was not designed with the intention of modeling bulk liquid properties of organic molecules~\cite{gaff,gaff2}
This is reasonably consistent with previous studies reporting agreement of 4\% on a different benchmark set~\cite{caleman2011force}.

For a given compound, the errors are roughly similar at different temperatures (Fig. ~\ref{figure:AllDensities}).  Overall, the predictions give an average density of $947 \pm 9$ $kg / m^3$, while the measurements give an average density of $928 \pm 8$ $kg / m^3$.  

The largest density errors occur for 1,4-dioxane, 2,5,8-trioxanonane, 2-aminoethanol, dimethyl carbonate, formamide, and water.  The absolute error on these poor predictions is on the order of 50 $kg / m^3$, which is substantially higher than the measurement error ($\le 8$ $kg / m^3$; see Fig.~\ref{figure:ErrorAnalysisDensity}).

% DIELECTRIC
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Static dielectric constant}

As a measure of the dielectric response, the static dielectric constant of neat liquids provides a critical benchmark of the accuracy electrostatic treatment in forcefield models.  
We therefore compare simulations against the measurements in our ThermoML extract.  
Overall, we find the dielectric constants to be qualitatively reasonable, but with clear deviations from experiment.  
In particular, GAFF/AM1-BCC systematically underestimates the dielectric constants for nonpolar organics, with the predictions of $\epsilon \approx 1.0 \pm 0.05$ being substantially smaller than the measured $\epsilon \approx 2$.  
Because this deviation likely stems from the lack of an explicit treatment of electronic polarization, we used a simple empirical polarization model that computes the molecular electronic polarizability $\alpha$ a sum of elemental atomic polarizability contributions~\cite{bosque2002polarizabilities}.
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:sales}
%\begin{split}
%\alpha/\textnormal{\AA} = 1.53 \, n_C + 0.17 \, n_H + 0.57 \, n_O + 1.05 \, n_N + 2.99 \, n_S \\ + 2.48 \, n_P + 0.22 \, n_F + 2.16 \, n_{Cl} + 3.29 \, n_{Br} + 5.45 \, n_I + 0.32 
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}
%{\color{red}[JDC: I've commented out the equation because I don't think it is central to our point. Essentially, it is just an atom-based linear model for computing the molecular polarizability, and the parameters can be looked up elsewhere.]} 
From the computed molecular electronic polarizability $\alpha$, an additive correction to the simulation-derived static dielectric constant accounting for the missing electronic polarizability can be computed~\cite{horn2004}
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta \epsilon &=& 4 \pi N  \frac{\alpha}{\langle V \rangle} \label{equation:dielectric correction}
\end{eqnarray}
While a similar polarization correction was used in the development of the TIP4P-Ew water model, where it had a minor effect~\cite{horn2004}, missing polarizability is a dominant contribution to the static dielectric constant of nonpolar organic molecules;   
in the case of water, the empirical atomic polarizability model predicts a dielectric correction of 0.52, while 0.79 was used for the TIP4P-Ew model.  
Considering all predictions in the present work leads to polarizability corrections to the static dielectric of $0.74 \pm 0.08$.
%For comparison, we also applied the same empirical correction to the VirtualChemistry dataset~\cite{caleman2011force, van2012gromacs} and saw similarly improved agreement with experiment for both the GAFF and OPLS forcefields (Fig. \ref{figure:VirtualChemistry}).

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Mass densities}

Our simulations have indicated the presence of systematic densities biases with magnitudes larger than the measurement error.  
Correcting these errors may be a low-hanging fruit for future forcefield refinements.
As an example of the feasiblity of improved accuracy in densities, a recent three-point water model was able to recapitulate water density with errors of less than 5 $kg \ m^3$ over temperature range [280 K, 320 K].
This improved accuracy in density prediction was obtained alongside accurate predictions of other experimental observables, including static dielectric constant.  
We suspect that such accuracy might be obtainable for GAFF-like forcefields across some portion of chemical space.  
A key challenge for the field is to demarcate the fundamental limit of fixed-charge forcefields for predicting orthogonal classes of experimental observables.
For example, is it possible to achieve a relative density error of $10^{-4}$ without sacrificing accuracy of other properties such as enthalpies?
In our opinion, the best way to answer such questions is to systematically build forcefields with the goal of predicting various properties to within their known experimental uncertainties, similar to what has been done for water \cite{horn2004, wang2014building}.

\subsection{Dielectric constants in forcefield parameterization}

Recent forcefield development has seen a resurgence of papers fitting dielectric constants during forcefield parameterization \cite{wang2014building, fennell2014fixed}.  
However, a number of authors have pointed out potential challenges in constructing self-consistent fixed-charge forcefields \cite{fennell2012simple, leontyev2014polarizable}.  

Interestingly, recent work by Dill and coworkers~\cite{fennell2012simple} observed that, for $\mathrm{CCl_4}$, reasonable choices of point charges are incapable of recapitulating the observed dielectric of $\epsilon = 2.2$, instead producing dielectric constants in the range of $1.0 \le \epsilon \le 1.05$.  
This behavior is quite general: fixed point charge forcefields will predict $\epsilon \approx 1$ for many nonpolar or symmetric molecules, but the measured dielectric constants are instead $\epsilon \approx 2$ (Fig.~\ref{figure:nonpolars}).  
While this behavior is well-known and results from missing physics of polarizability, we suspect it may have several profound consequences, which we discuss below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Suppose, for example, that one attempts to fit forcefield parameters to match the static dielectric constants of $\mathrm{CCl_4}$, $\mathrm{CHCl_3}$, $\mathrm{CH_2Cl_2}$, and $\mathrm{CH_3Cl}$.
In moving from the tetrahedrally-symmetric $\mathrm{CCl_4}$ to the asymmetric $\mathrm{CHCl_3}$, it suddenly becomes possible to achieve the observed dielectric constant of 4.8 by an appropriate choice of point charges.
However, the model for $\mathrm{CHCl_3}$ uses fixed point charges to account for \emph{both} the permanent dipole moment and the electronic polarizability, whereas the $\mathrm{CCl_4}$ model contains no treatment of polarizability.  
We hypothesize that this inconsistency in parameterization may lead to strange mismatches, where symmetric molecules (e.g.~benzene and $\mathrm{CCl_4}$) have qualitatively different properties than closely related asymmetric molecules (e.g.~toluene and $\mathrm{CHCl_3}$).

How important is this effect?
As a possible real-world example, we imagine that the missing atomic polarizability could be important in accurate transfer free energies involving low-dielectric solvents, such as the small-molecule transfer free energy from octanol or cyclohexane to water.  
The Onsager model for solvation of a dipole $\mu$ of radius $a$ gives us a way to estimate the magnitude of error introduced by making an error $\Delta \epsilon$ the static dielectric constant of a solvent.
The free energy of dipole solvation is given by this odel as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:onsager}
\Delta G = -\frac{\mu^2}{a^3}\frac{\epsilon - 1}{2 \epsilon + 1}
\end{equation}
such that, for an error of $\Delta \epsilon$ departing from the true static dielectric constant $\epsilon$, we find the error in solvation is
\begin{equation} \label{equation:onsager-error}
\Delta \Delta G = -\frac{\mu^2}{a^3} \left[ \frac{(\epsilon+\Delta \epsilon) - 1}{2 (\epsilon+\Delta \epsilon) + 1} - \frac{\epsilon - 1}{2 \epsilon + 1} \right] 
\end{equation}
For example, the solvation of water ($a = 1.93$~\AA, $\mu = 2.2$~D) in a low dielectric medium such as tetrachloromethane or benzene ($\epsilon \sim 2.2$, but $\Delta \epsilon = -1.2$) gives an error of $\Delta \Delta G \sim -2$ kcal/mol.

The ramifications can be relevant for quantities of interest to drug discovery projects.
Consider the transfer of small druglike molecules from a nonpolar solvent (such as cyclohexane) to water, a property often measured to indicate the expected degree of lipophilicity of a compound.
To estimate the magnitude of error expected, for each molecule in the latest (Feb. 20) FreeSolv database~\cite{freesolv, freesolv_github}, we estimated the expected error in computed transfer free energies should GAFF/AM1-BCC be used to model the nonpolar solvent cyclohexane using the Onsager model (Eq.~\ref{equation:onsager-error}).
We used took the cavity radius $a$ to be the half the maximum interatomic distance and calculated $\mu = \sum_i q_i r_i$ using the provided mol2 coordinates and AM1-BCC charges.  
This calculation predicts a mean error of $-0.91 \pm0.07$ kcal / mol for the 643 molecules (where the standard error is computed from bootstrapping over FreeSolv compound measurements), 
suggesting that the missing atomic polarizabilty unrepresentable by fixed point charge forcefields could contribute substantially to errors in predicted transfer and solvation properties of druglike molecules.  
We conjecture that this missing physics will be important in the upcoming (2015) SAMPL challenge \cite{newman2009practical}, which will examine transfer free energies in several low dielectric media. 

Given their ease of measurement and direct connection to long-range electrostatic interactions, static dielectric constants have high potential utility as primary data for forcefield parameterization efforts.  
Although this will require the use of forcefields with explicit treatment of atomic polarizability, the inconsistency of fixed-charge models in low-dielectric media is sufficiently alarming to motivate further study of polarizable forcefields.  In particular, continuum methods~\cite{truchon2010using, truchon2009integrated, truchon2008accurate}, point dipole methods~\cite{Ponder2010, ren2004temperature}, and Drude methods~\cite{lamoureux2003modeling, anisimov2005determination} have been maturing rapidly.  Finding the optimal balance of accuracy and performance remains an open question; however, the use of experimentally-parameterized direct polarization methods~\cite{wang2013systematic} may provide polarizability physics at a cost not much greater than fixed charge forcefields.


\subsection{ThermoML as a data source}

The present work has focused on the neat liquid density and dielectric measurements present in the ThermoML Archive~\cite{frenkel2006xml, frenkel2003thermoml, chirico2003thermoml} as a target for molecular dynamics forcefield validation.  
While liquid mass densities and static dielectric constants have already been widely used in forcefield work, several aspects of ThermoML make it a unique resource for the forcefield community.  
First, the aggregation, support, and dissemination of ThermoML datasets through the ThermoML Archive is supported by NIST, whose mission makes these tasks a long-term priority.  
Second, the ThermoML Archive is actively growing, through partnerships with several journals, and new experimental measurements published in these journals are critically examined by the TRC and included in the archive.  
Finally, the files in the ThermoML Archive are portable and machine readable via a formal XML schema, allowing facile access to hundreds of thousands of measurements.  
Numerous additional physical properties contained in ThermoML---including activity coefficients, diffusion constants, boiling point temperatures, critical pressures and densities, coefficients of expansion, speed of sound measurements, viscosities, excess molar enthalpies, heat capacities, and volumes---for neat phases and mixtures represent a rich dataset of high utility for forcefield validation and parameterization.

{\color{red}[JDC: Can we give some other statistics (maybe in a table) of the numbers of other kinds of measurements contained in ThermoML?]}

\section{Conclusions}

High quality, machine-readable datasets of physicochemical measurements will be required for the construction of next-generation small molecule forcefields.  
Here we have discussed the NIST/TRC ThermoML archive as a growing source of physicochemical measurements that may be useful for the forcefield community.
From the NIST/TRC ThermoML archive, we selected a dataset of 245 ambient, neat liquid systems for which both densities and static dielectric constants are available.  
Using this dataset, we benchmarked GAFF/AM1-BCC, one of the most popular small molecule forcefields.
We find systematic biases in densities and particularly static dielectric constants.
Element-based empirical polarizabilty models are able to account for much of the systematic differences between GAFF/AM1-BCC and experiment, 
suggesting that non-polarizable forcefields may show unacceptable biases in certain situations---possibly including the upcoming 2015 SAMPL challenge for transfer free energies.

(a).  The density is shown for several choices of timestep.  
(b).  The relative error, as compared to the reference value, is shown for several choices of timestep.  
Error bars represent stand errors of the mean, with the number of effective samples estimated using pymbar's statistical inefficiency routine \cite{shirts2008statistically}.  
The reference value is estimated by linear extrapolation to 0 fs using the 0.5 fs and 1.0 fs data points; the linear extrapolation is shown as black lines.  
We find a 2~fs timestep leads to systematic biases in the density on the order of 0.13\%, while 1 fs reduces the systematic bias to approximately 0.08\%---we therefore selected a 1~fs timestep for the present work, where we aimed to achieve three digits of accuracy in density predictions.

\caption{{\bf Assessment of experimental error: Density}
To assess the experimental error in our ThermoML extract, we compared three difference estimates of uncertainty.  
In the first approach (Weighted), we computed the standard deviation of the optimally weighted average of the measurements, using the uncertainties reported by authors ($\sigma_{Weighted} = [\sum_k \sigma_k^{-2}]^{-0.5}$).
This uncertainty estimator places the highest weights on measurements with small uncertainties and is therefore easily dominated by small outliers and uncertainty under-reporting.
In the second approach (Median), we estimated the median of the uncertainties reported by authors; this statistic should be robust to small and large outliers of author-reported uncertainties.
In the third approach (Std), we calculated at the standard deviation of independent measurements reported in the ThermoML extract, completely avoiding the author-reported uncertainties.
Plot (a) compares the three uncertainty estimates.
We see that author-reported uncertainties appear to be substantially smaller than the scatter between the observed measurements.
A simple psychological explanation might be that because density measurements are more routine, the authors simply report the accuracy limit of their hardware (e.g. 0.0001 g / mL for a Mettler Toledo DM40~\cite{mettlertoledo}).  
However, this hardware limit is not achieved due to inconsistencies in sample preparation; see Appendix in Ref.~\cite{chirico2013improvement}.  
Panel (b) shows the same information as (a) but as a function of the measurement index, rather than as a scatter plot---because not all measurements have author-supplied uncertainties, panel (c) contains slightly more data points than (a, b).
